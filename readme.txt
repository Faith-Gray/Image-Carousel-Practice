Image carousel practice. I learn many cool techniques with this project. Firstly I was able to simply my code by making functions that I could call when hitting the previous button, the next button,and the dots below the picture. I also learned you can make an array in javascript by putting the children of an element into an array. This would have been helpful during previous projects.
